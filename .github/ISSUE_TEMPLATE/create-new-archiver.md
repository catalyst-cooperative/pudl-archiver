### Motivation and context:

Briefly describe the dataset. What is it, and why do we want to archive it regularly?
Include a link to the dataset webpage and any metadata documentation.

#### Requirements for archiving

To be archived on Zenodo, a dataset must be:
- [ ] published under an open license that permits reuse and redistribution
- [ ] less than 50Gb in size (when zipped)
- [ ] relevant to energy modelling and research

### Checklist for archive creation
